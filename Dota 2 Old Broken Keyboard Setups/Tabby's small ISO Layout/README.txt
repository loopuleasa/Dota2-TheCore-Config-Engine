This is the core engine that you can use to tweak all aspects of the game the way you want it.
Each file has a role, and modify what you want in it.

Supported stuff:
- Alt as modifier key
- Space as modifier key
- Quickcast/Normal cast mode toggle
- Hero custom modes
- Split config files structure, for ease of editing



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	Autoexec engine
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- autoexec.cfg

Manages the core functionality of the other files. It's loaded automatically by dota2. 

- game_convars.vcfg

Changed a bit to load autoexec.cfg automatically like in Legacy



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	dota2_gameplay_mode folder
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains all the .cfg files that are loaded
and they control the game settings and binds as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------

- dota2_functions_active.cfg

This file holds all the aliases and custom defined functions made by the user.


- dota2_keybinds_default.cfg
- dota2_keybinds_space_pressed.cfg
- dota2_keybinds_alt_pressed.cfg

These three files are full of "bind" commands which connect one key on your keyboard to a function or command.
Each one of them is responsible for setting the keybinds for either default mode (no ALT or SPACE key pressed), alt mode (ALT+Key) or space mode (SPACE+Key).
Basically, when you press ALT, the keys from dota2_keybinds_alt_pressed are active, and when SPACE is pressed, the keys from dota2_keybinds_space_pressed are active.


- dota2_settings_game.cfg

This file contains all the game tweaks and settings (minimap, camera, various toggles, and many options related directly to the game)


- dota2_settings_tech.cfg

This file contains all the graphical, visual and technical options that are more related to the computer that is running dota2 and not the game itself.


- dota2_keybinds_toggle_quickcast
- dota2_keybinds_toggle_non-quickcast

These two files are loaded depending on which mode is enabled by my engine(quickcast on or off). You shouldn't modify them, but you can use the aliases defined inside for your pleasure.



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	dota2_hero_custom_configs folder
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

---------------------------------------------------------
Inside this folder, you will have hero custom configs that 
you can load by typing a command in the console (or setting up a bind). 
They're used to add custom keybinds that were designed 
specifically for a single hero. 
Check the readme inside the folder on how to use them.
