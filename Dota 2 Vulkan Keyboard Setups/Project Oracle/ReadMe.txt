Where did you get the name "Project Oracle"?
Oracle is the only hero for which every ability benefits from all three cast types.

For all items, quick-cast is bound to mouse5 d f x c v (but can be changed in-game).

Some exceptions have been made using the custom hero bindings in-game for abilities which do not benefit from Default-cast. Space plus the hotkey instead self-casts these abilities.
1. IO's relocate
2. Treant's living armor
3. Meepo's poof
4. Nature's Prophet's teleportation
5. And all auto-cast abilities (self-cast toggles them on or off)
