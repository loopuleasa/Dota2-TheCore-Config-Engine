To Install:

1.	Unbind all of your hotkeys in-game and bind all 43 keys exactly how you see them in the three screenshots.
	30 of these keys are alt+[some other key]. You must hold down alt and press the desired key to bind them.
	12 of the keys are for the quick-cast item binds inorder to use Valve's version of self-cast.
	The last key rebinds the alt modifier to space.

2.	Place everything that is inside "Loopuleasa's Super Compact QWERTG-DFXCV layout (ALT,SPACE mods)" inside of
	"Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg".
	Tournament users do not proceed to step 3.
	
3.	If you wish to have a keyboard layout 99% similar to the old Loopuleasa, run the .ahk. (Optional)
	You must have https://autohotkey.com/ installed.


WARNINGS:

1. While Alt+F8 reloads the auto hotkey script, it does not reload the autoexec. There is a high chance you will desynchronize the toggle logic between the 
scripts if you reload one without the other.
The only way to currently reload the autoexec is to restart dota2.exe. Alt+F8 should not used by players and is only for careful developers.


FAQ:

Q: Am I required to run ahk?
A: No, the fix defaults to Tournament mode if ahk is not running.

Q: Will I be banned for running the .ahk?
A: Absolutely not. The ahk script works by providing keyboard shortcuts so you can reach the other side of your keyboard easily.
	It does not contain macros (except for the swift courier script).
	
Q: You talk about two different versions "Tournament" and "ahk" but I only see one choice of files to install.
A: The both "Tournament" and "ahk" versions use the same file installations. The difference is whether or not you are running the ahk script.
	
Q: What are the new brown and dark green binds I see in the visual maps. They are visual and audio confirmations for the toggles.
A: Tournament users don't worry about them. They aren't useful to you.
	AHK users, your keyboard shortcuts hit those keys when you press a toggle.

Q: Will there be any updates in the future?
A: Very few or none. Everything is implemented and working 100%.

Q: What does Loopuleasa think of this?
A: He opposes the use of 3rd party programs. The "ahk" uses the 3rd party program auto-hotkey. The "Tournament" version does not.

Q: How long did this fix take you to make?
A: About 60 hours.
