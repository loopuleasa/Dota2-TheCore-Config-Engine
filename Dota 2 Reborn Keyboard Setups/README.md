#What are these?

These are different keyboard setups made by different contributors. 

Check inside the folders to see what is available.

For starters I recommend my (loopuleasa) super compact layout if you wish to try out the engine.

If you wish to make one of your own, and maybe share it with the world, then start from the CORE layout, which is only the core engine with no binds setup.
