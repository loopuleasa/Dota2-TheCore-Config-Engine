# hk_binds folder
This folder contains the files that are run when a hero is selected to set the keybinds specific to that hero. They are run on the second and subsequent calls of "current_hero".

The commands for binding keys to hero fumctions have been simplified with certain aliases, to make it easer and more readable, in the form prefix_type_number

### Prefixes
1. normal - This specifies the regular casting of a spell / item
2. quick - This specifies the quick-casting of a spell / item
3. self - This specifies the self-casting of a spell / item
4. autocast - Toggles the autocast status of a skill such as Drow's Frost arrows

### Type
1. item
2. ability

### Numbering
The abilities "Q", "W" and "E" are numbered 0-2, the subskills ("D" and "F") are 3 and 4, while the ultimate ability is 5.

Items are numbered from top left to botom right, across the top and then the bottom.

## Keys
Most keys on the keyboard and mouse can be bound, however there are some things to be wary of. The numpad is referenced slightly differently, e.g. "KP_5"

The mouse buttons are able to be bound starting at "mouse4", as mouse1-3 are unable to be rebound.
