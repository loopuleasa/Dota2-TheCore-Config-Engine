#What's in this folder?

This folder is responsible for gameplay functionality.

- Edit the "dota2_keybinds_..." cfg files for the actual binds for all the modes.

- Edit the "dota2_settings_..." cfg files for the game and tech settings.

- Edit the "aliases/dota2_functions_active" cfg file for the custom scripts that you wish to bind.

- Leave the other files in the "aliases/..." folder untouched, since they handle switching functionalities.
