Where did you get the name "Project Oracle"?
Oracle is the only hero for which every ability benefits from all three cast types.



Mission:

To implement two modifiers for Windows users.

SteamOS users can already use the super key as a modifier by default and other linux users can disable ALL of their super key shortcuts inorder to use two modifiers in DotA 2.

By using a very small ahk script (15 lines of code), the Windows key can be sent to dota2.exe but not to the Windows OS when LAlt is pressed. 

This allows Windows users to enjoy two modifiers aswell. The best part about it is you can still use your Windows Key shortcuts outside of DotA!

If you prefer to disable your Windows Key everywhere, you can do that too by following a tutorial from a quick Google search.



To Install:

1. Place either the 32-bit or the 64-bit .exe, depending upon your system, in your StartUp folder (I have provided a shortcut).
   You can use the .ahk instead if you have installed AutoHotKey.

2. Place the "Game" folder inside of "Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta" and overwrite

3. Place the "570" folder inside of "Steam\userdata\ [Your 9 digit Steam ID here] " and overwrite

4. Reboot your computer or run the .exe you chose from step 1 manually

Optional:

5. launch DotA 2 and customize to your liking

6. renable any WinKey shortcuts you have previously disabled by running the .reg file


Customization:
Project Oracle makes use of smart ordering of hotkeys for some heroes which have more than four abilities.
You can easily get rid of the ones you don't like in game by clicking the clear button for a particular hero.
The affected heroes are listed below:

1. Earth Spirit

2. IO

3. Lifestealer

4. Phoenix

5. Timbersaw

6. Lone Druid

7. Morphling

8. Spectre

9. Templar Assasin

10. Chen

11. Keeper of the Light

12. Ogre Magi

13. Puck

14. Rubick

15. Shadow Demon

16. Techies



Known Issues:

1. Self-cast abilities which are auto-castable are self-casted when the auto-cast hotkey is pressed.
Only affects Ogre Magi, Lich, and neutral troll priest. This is a valve bug and out of my control.



Work-arounds:

1. You have to Alt-Tab out of dota using LCtrl-Tab for now.
